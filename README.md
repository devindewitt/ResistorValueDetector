# ResistorValueDetector
Attempting to train a CNN to detect resistor values by image

This repository will serve as a place to store ideas about this project as well as goals for the end result.
My current plan is to train a CNN that will be able to take an image of a resistor and output the correct value.

GOALS:
Mobile Application
If I am successful at building an accurate system, what is accurate to be determined later, I would be interested
in building an app for mobile platforms. Users would than be able to use an Android/iOS device's camera to obtain 
component values

Support for other components, i.e. capacitors
Expanding the system to support other components by image would be an additional goal. Capacitors would be the
obvious choice for an initial expansion of the system

Cloud Hosting
Hosting the application online and allow users to connect to it remotely. This would allow people to use the system as long as they are connected to the internet.

Structure
I am unsure on the basic CNN structure I will be attempting to use. My plan is to currently build the network 
from scratch and follow a well documented and proven process. I am doing this to become more proficient in building 
and understanding both CNN and NN architecture.
